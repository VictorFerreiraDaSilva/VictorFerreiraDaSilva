# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Victor**, a **B.Sc. in Information Systems** based in Brazil.

I work with Data Analysis and Software Engineering. I enjoy building practical solutions, from setting up containers to writing automation scripts with **Python** and **JavaScript**.

Most of my work currently lives in private repositories within organizations, but I'm starting to open-source more of my personal labs here.

### Beyond Coding:
* 📸 **Photography:** Always loved it, finally doing it. I recently picked up a camera to start learning from scratch. My progress [here](https://instagram.com/victorfs.jpg).
* 🏐 **Sports:** Gym, swimming, and casual volleyball. Trying to juggle it all and get shredded.
* 🎬 **Downtime:** I'm constantly rotating between gaming, reading, and movies — I enjoy a little bit of everything.
